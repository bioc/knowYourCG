Description: This package automates the hypothesis testing process by testing
    the enrichment of different pre-curated sets of CpGs. Each CpG set, or 
    databaseSet, corresponds to a genomic or technical element that aims
    to describe variability in a CpG set of interest, also know as a querySet.
