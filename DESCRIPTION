Description: Automates the discovery of biological and technical links in DNA 
    methylation data. knowYourCG tests enrichment of discrete or continuous input
    query sets across thousands of curated biological and technical features. 
    Unsupervised analyses of beta matrices may also be performed to discover
    methylation correlation networks.
