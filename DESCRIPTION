Description: knowYourCG automates the functional enrichment analysis of DNA 
    methylation data. The enrichment of both discrete and continuous input
    query sets can be tested across thousands of curated biological 
    and technical features. knowYourCG can also perform unsupervised analyses 
    of beta matrices for the discovery of methylation correlation networks.
