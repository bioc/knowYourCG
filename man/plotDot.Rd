\title{Dot plot to show most enriched CG groups from testEnrichment}
\usage{
plotDot(
  df,
  y = "-log10(FDR)",
  n = 20,
  order_by = "FDR",
  size_by = "overlap",
  color_by = "estimate"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{KYCG result data frame}

\item{y}{the column to be plotted on y-axis}

\item{n}{number of CG groups to plot}

\item{order_by}{the column by which CG groups are ordered}

\item{size_by}{the column by which CG group size plot}

\item{color_by}{the column by which CG groups are colored}
}
\value{
grid plot object (by ggplot)
}
\description{
The input data frame should have an "estimate" and
a "FDR" columns.
}
\details{
Top CG groups are determined by estimate (descending order).
}
\examples{
plotDot(data.frame(
  estimate=runif(10,0,10), FDR=runif(10,0,1), nD=runif(10,10,20),
  overlap=as.integer(runif(10,0,30)), group="g", dbname=seq_len(10)))
}
