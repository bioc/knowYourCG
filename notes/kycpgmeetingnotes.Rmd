# 20210731 Meeting
1. [x?] Cache on file level and memory level
    a. Systems engineering problem, optimize what is loaded in memory
    b. https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BiocFileCache.html
2. EWAS validation, disocvery?
    a. Database sets must be related to associated variable under study
        i. PM20DI in Alzheimer's EWAS
        ii. Smoking?
        iii. e.g. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-018-0229-9
3. Network showing pairwise distnaces between database sets
    a. Find redundancy
    b. Identify community subgraphs/structures in the network, densly connected
    subgraphs, analyze different subgraphs separately
    b. OPTIONAL: Reconstruct biological mechanisms, transcription regulation 
    network
4. [x] Find continious database/query set examples to show in Vignette
    a. FGSEA and Spearman
5. [x] Tissue specific hypomethylation in mouse validation; i.e. like Brain
    a. Figure should show top hits, volcano plot?

# 20210806
Could we perform a memory-level cahce by ording the bfc in term of most recently used and track which files are currnetly loaded in a separate column and only load the most recent ones and unload the older ones?

# 20210807
Or we could FIFO queue 
Or we could do batching of databaseSets for every querySet

1. Work on memory level caching
2. Fix the Dist2TSS database set
    a. Focus on min for distToTSS
    b. Use bedtools closest -d to find those TSS that are closest to a given probe, gene body independent distance.
    c. Use /mnt/isilon/zhou_lab/projects/20191221_references/mm10/annotation/transcripts/gencode.v28.annotation.gtf.tss.bed
3. Work on testDatabaseSetRedundancy, use Jacard Index?
    a. Display using CytoScape
